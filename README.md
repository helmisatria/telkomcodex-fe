# Telkom Codex Frontend

For this tourney we have two repositories. One for backend and one for frontend. For the frontend we write it using **Vue.js**. For the backend we use **typescript + expressjs**.

For the preview you can access it in [http://telkomcodex.surge.s](http://telkomcodex.surge.sh/)h. Unfortunately we deploy the backend in **heroku**, whereas it has **sleep time and limited bandwidth**, thus make it a bit harder to use.
